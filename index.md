# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/mtez09/montez-carter.github.io/blob/master/Projects/Linear_Regression_Project%5B1%5D%20(1).ipynb)

<img src="https://github.com/mtez09/montez-carter.github.io/blob/master/images/bike%20rentals.jpg?raw=true"/>
- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration
- Performance scores of (Mean Absolute Error of linear regression: 94, Mean Square Error of linear regression: 17896, R_Squared Score of linear regression: 0.3)

[Predicting if a Customer will subscribe to term deposits using a logistic classifier](https://github.com/mtez09/montez-carter.github.io/blob/master/Projects/Logistic%20Regression%20Project%20(1).ipynb)

<img src="https://github.com/mtez09/montez-carter.github.io/blob/master/images/bank%20deposit.jpg?raw=true"/>

- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y)
- Create the prediction system to get the metrics such as accuracy
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to term deposits

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/mtez09/montez-carter.github.io/blob/master/Projects/KNN_NB_Project%20(1).ipynb)

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
- Performance scores (Correct predictions:  56, False predictions: 22, Accuracy of the Naive Bayes Clasification is 71.79%)


[Predicting whether a given click is fraudulent (or equivalently, whether a given click will result in a download](https://github.com/mtez09/montez-carter.github.io/blob/master/Projects/Bagging_Boosting_Project.ipynb)

<img src="https://github.com/mtez09/montez-carter.github.io/blob/master/images/clicks%20image.png?raw=true"/>

- Explored the dataset for anomalies and missing values and take corrective actions
- Gathered the maximum number of unique values present among all the available columns
- Divided the data into training and testing subsets into 80:20 ratio 
- Found the accuracy for BaggingClassifier and XGBoostClassifier
- Accuracy of the Decision Tree is (99.74%)
